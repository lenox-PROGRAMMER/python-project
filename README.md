# 🚀 My Beginner Python Projects  

Welcome to my collection of Python projects! As I explore backend development and database systems, these projects reflect my journey in learning programming concepts, structuring logic, and implementing real-world applications.

## 📌 Projects Included  

1. **Aviator Betting Game** 🎰  
   - Implements rigged multiplier logic for simulated betting.  
   - Uses real-time tracking of total bets for outcome control.  

2. **Simple Calculator** ➗ 
   # Calculator Project 🧮

## Overview
This is a simple calculator program written in Python. It supports basic arithmetic operations including:
- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Division (`/`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Modulus (`%`)

The program includes **error handling** for invalid inputs and division/modulus by zero.

## How to Use
1. Run the script in Python:
   ```bash
   python calculator.py
 

3. **Madlibs Generator** 🎭  
   - Creates fun, randomized stories based on user input.  
   - Modularized with functions for flexibility and clarity.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- Python  
- PostgreSQL (for backend in future versions)  
- Git & GitHub
